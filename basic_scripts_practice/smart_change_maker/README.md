## Create a change maker that:

- Takes a payment amount and purchase price as input

- Calculates the change owed

- Determines the minimum number of coins/bills needed

- Shows the breakdown of each denomination

- Handles different currency denominations (quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)

- Works with both coins and bills ($100, $50, $20, $10, $5, $1)

## Bonus (optional):

- Add support for international currencies (Euro, British Pound)

- Create a visualization showing the coins/bills

- Handle edge cases (exact change, no change needed)

- Add a “what if” feature to explore different denominations
