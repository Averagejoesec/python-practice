## Create an expense logger that:

Uses functions to organize different operations

Allows users to add expenses with amount, category, and description

Stores expenses in a Python list (in-memory for now)

Displays all expenses in a clean, formatted output

Calculates and shows total spending

Shows spending breakdown by category

Uses a simple menu system for user interaction
