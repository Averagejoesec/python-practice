## Create an expense logger that:

Uses functions to organize different operations

Allows users to add expenses with amount, category, and description

Stores expenses in a Python list (in-memory for now)

Displays all expenses in a clean, formatted output

Calculates and shows total spending

Shows spending breakdown by category

Uses a simple menu system for user interaction

## Phase 2

Uses an Expense class to represent individual expenses

Uses an ExpenseTracker class to manage all expenses

Stores expense data as object attributes

Implements methods for adding, viewing, and analyzing expenses

Maintains the same functionality as Day 1 but with better structure

Demonstrates how classes encapsulate data and behavior together

## Phase 3

Create an expense tracker with storage and budgets that:

Saves all expenses to a CSV file automatically

Loads existing expenses when the program starts

Allows users to set budget limits for each category

Warns users when they’re approaching budget limits (80% threshold)

Alerts users when they exceed budgets

Shows budget status in the summary view

Maintains all previous functionality (classes, viewing, totals)

## Phase 4

Create a web-based finance tracker dashboard that:

Uses Streamlit to create an interactive web interface

Displays an input form to add new expenses

Shows all expenses in a formatted table

Reads from and writes to the CSV file from Day 3

Generates a pie chart showing spending by category

Creates a bar chart comparing category totals

Shows budget warnings with visual indicators

Calculates and displays summary statistics

Uses our Expense and ExpenseTracker classes from previous days
