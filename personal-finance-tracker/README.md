## Create an expense logger that:

Uses functions to organize different operations

Allows users to add expenses with amount, category, and description

Stores expenses in a Python list (in-memory for now)

Displays all expenses in a clean, formatted output

Calculates and shows total spending

Shows spending breakdown by category

Uses a simple menu system for user interaction

## Phase 2

Uses an Expense class to represent individual expenses

Uses an ExpenseTracker class to manage all expenses

Stores expense data as object attributes

Implements methods for adding, viewing, and analyzing expenses

Maintains the same functionality as Day 1 but with better structure

Demonstrates how classes encapsulate data and behavior together
