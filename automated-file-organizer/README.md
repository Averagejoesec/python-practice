## Project Task
Create an automated file organizer that:

Scans a specified folder (like Downloads) for files

Categorizes files by extension (Images, Documents, Videos, Music, etc.)

Creates category folders automatically if they don’t exist

Moves files to their appropriate category folders

Handles duplicate filenames by adding numbers

Displays a summary of how many files were organized

Can be run manually or scheduled to run automatically

Works with common file types (jpg, png, pdf, mp4, mp3, etc.)

This project gives you hands-on practice with file operations, automation, directory management, and building utilities that save time — essential skills for creating practical tools that improve productivity.
